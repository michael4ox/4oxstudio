          Artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT has analyzed the potential
          impact of AI on jobs. According to ChatGPT, data entry clerks are the
          most vulnerable to automation, as AI-powered software can easily
          perform their tasks.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          Other professions that could be at risk include receptionists,
          administrative assistants, and customer service representatives, as
          AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants become more advanced.
          <br /><br />
          Surprisingly, professions such as real estate agents, insurance
          underwriters, and truck drivers are also identified as being at risk.
          AI technology may change the dynamics of real estate transactions,
          making it easier for buyers and sellers to interact directly.
          AI-driven algorithms have also emerged in insurance underwriting,
          potentially threatening traditional underwriters. <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, autonomous vehicles are expected to replace truck and
          delivery drivers in the near future.

        <p class="post-text">
          On the other hand, jobs that involve human interaction and skills that
          are difficult to replicate, such as healthcare professionals,
          teachers, psychologists, emergency services, and social workers, are
          considered to be at low risk from AI disruption. Creatives, such as
          artists and designers, can also breathe a sigh of relief, as AI has
          not yet mastered the art of creativity and imagination.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          High-paying jobs, including legal roles and senior executives and
          managers, are expected to remain relatively unaffected due to the
          critical decision-making and expertise required in these professions.
          The jobs identified as least at risk from AI disruption generally have
          higher average salaries, with senior executives earning an average of
          $110,000, according to Seek data.
