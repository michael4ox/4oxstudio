          Celta Vigo proved dauntless opponents for Real Madrid on Friday night
          and Los Blancos once again had Jude Bellingham to thank as his goal
          sealed the three points. Real saw Vinicius Jr go off injured early in
          the first half in a blow that robbed them of one of their chief
          creative outlets, but Bellingham - in his advanced role under Carlo

          Jude Bellingham scored again for Real Madrid as they earned a late 1-0
          win at Celta Vigo in La Liga on Friday night. Los Blancos were looking
          to extend their winning streak after two consecutive victories,
          already top of La Liga after falling short of Barcelona last season.

        <p class="post-text">
          Celta meanwhile were looking to add to their solitary point, and were
          unlucky to see Jorgen Strand Larsen have a goal disallowed as the
          referee believed new Madrid keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga had been impeded
          by the player seconds earlie
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          Carlo Ancelotti will have been disappointed to see Vinicius Jr. hobble
          off with an injury midway through the first half and Real were
          struggling for rhythm. <br />
          In the second half, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric were introduced just
          after the hour mark. Four minutes later, Rodrygo was brought down by
          Ivan Villar to earn a penalty, only for the keeper to save well from
          the Brazilian. But with just under 10 minutes remaining, Bellingham’s
          close-range header won it for the visitors.

        </h2>

        <p class="post-text">
          The Italian coach proclaimed once again that Real had done their
          business, but he must be tempted to rethink that promise. <br />
          The injury to VInicius, if serious, leaves Ancelotti with Joselu to
          play up front. He showed little against Celta to show that he can be a
          serious first-choice striker for the long term. <br />
          With a few days left, the prognosis for Vinicius could change the
          calculation.

          <strong>PLAYER OF THE MATCH - JUDE BELLINGHAM (REAL MADRID)? </strong>
        </h2>

        <p class="post-text">
          With Vinicius out, the evolution of Bellingham into a goalscoring
          midfielder could be a vital change for the Spaniards as they look to
          reclaim La Liga. <br />
          Four goals in three games for the former Borussia Dortmund man suggest
          that the huge outlay on the player is going to prove a bargain rather
          than a waste.
